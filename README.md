# McDonalds_Menu_Nutrition_Analysis

## Data Mining Mini Group Project (The University of Chicago, Physical Sciences Division)  

### Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

**Data**  
- This dataset provides a nutrition analysis of every menu item on the US McDonald's menu, including breakfast, beef burgers, chicken and fish sandwiches, fries, salads, soda, coffee and tea, milkshakes, and desserts.  

### Project Instructions

**Insights**
- How many calories does the average McDonald's value meal contain?  
- How much do beverages, like soda or coffee, contribute to the overall caloric intake?  
- Does ordered grilled chicken instead of crispy increase a sandwich's nutritional value?  
- What about ordering egg whites instead of whole eggs?  
- What is the least number of items could you order from the menu to meet one day's nutritional requirements?
